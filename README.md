# ADHD Biological Thought Nodes — Three.js Visualization

A **3D interactive visualization** representing an abstract ADHD thought topology using **Three.js** and **TypeScript**.

---

## Features

- Biological neuron-inspired abstract nodes floating in 3D space.
- **Drag and reposition** nodes in real-time.
- **Click to expand** nodes, triggering an animated particle burst — simulating dopamine hyperfocus spikes.
- Organic, dynamic motion representing **attention fluctuation**.
- Simple and extendable architecture built with **Three.js** + **GSAP**.

---

## Tech Stack

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) — 3D rendering
- TypeScript — strong typing
- Vite — dev server and bundler
- GSAP — animations (optional, can extend particle movement)
